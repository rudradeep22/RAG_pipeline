Poultry and other  meats should always be cooked before eating.12  Vegetarian and Vegan Diets  Vegetarian and vegan diets have been followed for thousands of  years for different reasons, including as part of a spiritual practice,  to show respect for living things, for health reasons, or because of  environmental concerns. For many people, being a vegetarian is a  logical outgrowth of “thinking green.” A meat-based food system  requires more energy, land, and water resources than a plant-based  food system. This may suggest that the plant-based diet is more  sustainable than the average meat-based diet in the U.S.By avoiding  animal flesh, vegetarians hope to look after their own health and  that of the planet at the same time. Broadly speaking, vegetarians  eat beans, grains, and fruits and vegetables, and do not eat red  meat, poultry, seafood, or any other animal flesh. Some vegetarians,  known as lacto vegetarians, will eat dairy products. Others, known  as lacto-ovo vegetarians, will eat dairy products and eggs. A vegan  diet is the most restrictive vegetarian diet—vegans do not eat dairy,  eggs, or other animal products, and some do not eat honey.  Vegetarian diets have a number of benefits. Well-balanced eating  plans can lower the risk of a number of chronic conditions,  including heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. They also help to  promote sustainable agriculture. However, if a vegetarian does not  vary his or her food choices, the diet may be insufficient in calcium,  12. Raw Food Diet. WebMD.com.https://www.webmd.com/ diet/a-z/raw-foods-diet.

Respectful Care: Promoting all aspects of health and well- being for people of all sizes 4.

These can be metabolically processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work, allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of measurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie multiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories, denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a capital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other macronutrients, it does not yield calories. Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.'"

      "1. **Carbohydrates**:\n",
      "\t* Major source of energy for the body (approximately 55-60% of daily energy needs)\n",
      "\t* Broken down into glucose, which is absorbed into the bloodstream and transported to cells for energy production\n",
      "\t* Simple carbohydrates (sugars) are quickly digested and provide rapid energy, while complex carbohydrates (starches and fibers) are digested more slowly and provide sustained energy\n",
      "\t* Examples: bread, pasta, fruits, vegetables, grains\n",
      "2. **Proteins**:\n",
      "\t* Build and repair tissues, such as muscles, bones, skin, and hair (approximately 15-20% of daily energy needs)\n",
      "\t* Played a crucial role in producing enzymes, hormones, and other biomolecules\n",
      "\t* Can be used as a source of energy when carbohydrate stores are depleted, but this is not their primary function\n",
      "\t* Examples: meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, legumes, nuts, and seeds\n",
      "3. **Fats**:\n",
      "\t* Provide energy for the body (approximately 20-35% of daily energy needs)\n",
      "\t* Help absorb fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and maintain healthy skin and mucous membranes\n",
      "\t* Also known as triglycerides, which are composed of glycerol and three fatty acid chains\n",
      "\t* Examples: fats, oils, butter, lard, nuts, and seeds\n",
      "\n",
      "Other important roles of macronutrients in the human body include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Regulation of blood sugar levels**: Carbohydrates and proteins help regulate blood sugar levels, preventing large fluctuations. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, regulates blood sugar levels by facilitating carbohydrate and protein absorption.\n",
      "* **Body temperature regulation**: Fats and proteins play a role in maintaining body temperature through the production of heat during metabolic processes.\n",
      "* **Hormone synthesis**: Fats and proteins are involved in the synthesis of various hormones, such as testosterone, estrogen, and thyroid hormones.\n",
      "* **Brain function and development**: Fatty acids, particularly omega-3 fatty acids, are essential for brain function and development.\n",
      "* **Circulation and cardiovascular health**: Fats are necessary for the production of cholesterol, which is essential for maintaining healthy liver function and producing bile acids that aid in fat digestion.\n",
      "\n",

      "    Context_items: - Dietary Sources of Protein The protein food group consists of foods made from meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, soy, dry beans, peas, and seeds. According to the Harvard School of Public Health, “animal protein and vegetable protein probably have the same effects on health. It’s the protein package that’s likely to make a difference.”1 1.

      "- Foods that contain some of the essential amino acids are called incomplete protein sources, while those that contain all nine essential amino acids are called complete protein sources, or high- quality protein sources. Foods that are complete protein sources include animal foods such as milk, cheese, eggs, fish, poultry, and meat, and a few plant foods, such as soy and quinoa. The only animal-based protein that is not complete is gelatin, which is made of the protein, collagen.

      "- Image by Braden Collum on unsplash.co m / CC0 Proteins in a Nutshell UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  Proteins are long chains of amino acids folded into precise structures that determine their functions, which are in the tens of thousands. They are the primary construction materials of the body serving as building blocks for bone, skin, hair, muscle, hormones, and antibodies. Without them we cannot breakdown or build macromolecules, grow, or heal from a wound. Too little protein impairs bodily functions and too much can lead to chronic disease. Eat proteins in moderation, at least 10 percent of the calories you take in and not more than 35 percent. Proteins are in a variety of foods. More complete sources are in animal-based foods, but choose those low in saturated fat and cholesterol. Some plant-based foods are also complete protein sources and don’t add much to your saturated fat or cholesterol intake. Incomplete protein sources can easily be combined in the daily diet and provide all of the essential Proteins in a Nutshell | 405\n",
      "- Protein-rich Foods by Smastronard o / CC BY-SA 4.0 Examples of complete protein sources include soy, dairy products, meat, and seafood. Examples of incomplete protein sources include legumes and corn. Most plant-based foods are deficient in at least one essential amino acid and therefore are incomplete protein sources. For example, grains are usually deficient in the amino acid lysine, and legumes are deficient in methionine or tryptophan. Because grains and legumes are not deficient in the same amino acids they can complement each other in a diet. Incomplete protein foods are called complementary foods because when consumed in tandem they contain all nine essential amino acids at adequate levels. Some examples of complementary protein foods are given in Table 6.4 “Complementing Protein Sources the Vegan Way”. Complementary protein sources do not have to be consumed at the same time—as long as they are consumed within the same day, you will meet your protein needs.

We will take a closer look at the special protein considerations for vegetarians, the elderly, and athletes. Vegetarians and Vegans People who follow variations of the vegetarian diet and consume eggs and/or dairy products can meet their protein requirements by consuming adequate amounts of these foods. Vegetarians and vegans can also attain their recommended protein intakes if they give a little more attention to high-quality plant-based protein sources. However, when following a vegetarian diet, the amino acid lysine can be challenging to acquire.
